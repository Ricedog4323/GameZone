    <h1>January 11st Saturday's news! 1.2 is here!</h1>
    <p>The homepage got moved to another file, so the index is now a welcoming page.</p>
    <p>Fun fact: I like roblox so much that i made a JS, HTML and CSS version of it!</p>
    <h1>January 6th Monday's news!</h1>
    <p>There's a blog instead of a Update Log</p>
    <p>Every game will be stored on cloud so when i lose my computer files, i can log in google and get them back</p>
    <p>I don't need to code a mobile version because people can make it (or not) in their code lol</p>
    <p>Fun fact: i'm almost 11yo</p>

    
<h1>
    The big launch!
